An Arduino library for the MCP23017 and MCP23S17 IO-expanders. Features include a consistent coherent API and the fact that all classes inherit from I_IOExpander16. This makes changing to a different IO Expander or using a mock IO Expander, such as for testing/debugging, trivial. Using the 8 and 16 bit versions of the methods will be much faster than changing a single bit at a time.
